# sudoku-solver
Efficient for problems like Sudoku where the solution space is large but well-structured.
This is a C++ implementation of a Sudoku Solver using backtracking. The program takes a partially filled Sudoku puzzle as input and finds a solution if one exists. It uses recursive backtracking to systematically try all possible configurations while ensuring the rules of Sudoku are followed.
